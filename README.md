## Example codes for implementing different techniques in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science

#### Note: The codes are combined from various sources across the internet

The following techniques have been implemented:

### Machine Learning:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-nn classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Random Forest Classifier
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* DBSCAN Clustering
* K-Means Clustering

### Data Analysis

* Data Analysis with Pandas
* PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
* Outlier Detection
* Feature Selection
